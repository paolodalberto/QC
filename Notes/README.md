# Reading Lists and Notes about them

This is in chronological order and the mispell are all mine. 

## Quantum Computing (A gentle Introduction)
https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-Introduction-Engineering-Computation/dp/0262526670
this ismy first read and I do not have much a memory of it.

## MAthematical Foundation of Quantum Mechanics 
This is by John von Neumann translation by Robert Beyer. I know you will make fun of me but I wanted to read written by Johnny and a translation he read himself and one day I may go back to try to understand it. ISBN-13 978-0691028934

## Quantum Computer Science (an introduction) 
This book is by David Mermin and I think I read this twice, the first time I Could not finish it. The second time I did by discipline alone.  ISBN-13  978-0521876582

## Introduction to classical and Quantum Computing
by Thomas Wong ISBN-13 979-8985593105
This is so far the book that eased me into the QC because it relies on explanations using also classic concept. It is a fast read. There are links to youtube. The authors really wants to engage and to excite an interest for the field. It is the first book that really let you have the first experiment using Bell's inequalities. No appendices and not fluffy things, but you can see that there is substance and the decisions not to explain are clear cut and the book is completely self contained. If you want to start, Wong's book is so far the best choice. 

## Quantum Computing with Python and IBM Quantum 
by Robert Loredo ISBN-13 978-1803244808
(1/2 the way through, this si a light introduction to the tools for designing, simulate, and run QC algorithms) From here I am trying to understand the building plock of the current implementation of the tools for QC.
